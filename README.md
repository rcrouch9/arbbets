# Welcome to ArbBets
This program searches mutliple online sportbooks and notifies you of arbitration opportunities that you can take advantage of and **guarantee** profit.

Simply clone this repo and run:
```
python3 main.py
```
# Features:
- Built using python3 & Sqlite3
- Scalable database with TTL capabilities
- Uses API fetching to collect consistent and formatted odds

# Further Improvements:
- Incorporate more sportsbooks to increase chances of finding an arb opportunity (theScore Bet, BetMGM, etc)
- Incorporate more sports and markets (Currently only supports NFL ML & Spread)
- Calculate wagers based on profit desired, not gross winnings
- Create user interface
